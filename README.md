4. Create '.env' file in the root folder and define the backend url

    ```bash
    VITE_BACKEND_URL = https://localhost:3000/v1 // change with the port you running the backend.
    VITE_FRONTEND_URL= http://localhost:5173/ // put the port your running the app

5. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev

The proyect should now be running in http://localhost:5173 if the port is free

For the Backend App need to do this:

if you already installed the Frontend app can skip the first step
